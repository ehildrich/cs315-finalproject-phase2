\section{Group Name}
Our group name is: Dottie Hildrich and Andrew Ruff.

\section{Group Participants}
Our group consists of: Andrew Ruff and Dottie Hildrich.

\section{Project Purpose and Outline}
The general purpose of the website remains the same as the project it is an
expanded version of: to teach beginners about the beverage coffee,
primarily its appreciation and the various aspects impacting its
flavor rather than actual brewing (brewing information is easy to find, this
sort of information is somewhat rarer). We expanded it by adding a survey,
a blog with reviews, and informational pages about coffee-based beverages.
These changes make the website more like something readers could keep coming
back to, because the survey allows us to collect reader feedback and the blog
could continue to be updated with more reviews. We also enhanced the website
by adding a responsive layout that will make it easier to use on mobile devices,
improving the user experience.

\section{Webpage Screenshots and Organization}
Note that these screenshots sometimes do not include the entire webpage.

\textbf{10 HTML Pages and Menu}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pages-menu}

These two screenshots demonstrate the drop-down menu function while also
showing our 10 HTML pages (the blog index is separate from the blog posts).

\textbf{Form and JSON}

\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{form}

This screenshot depicts our form page and its ability to show submitted form responses
using JavaScript.

\textbf{Table}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{table}

This screenshot shows an HTML table used to put blog posts and review scores
in an organized format.

\textbf{Animations}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{animations}

This screenshot shows two buttons with different animated drop shadows.
The animation can't be seen in the screenshot, but is present on the website.

\textbf{Transitions}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{mid-transition}

This screenshot depicts a link mid-transition. Our site uses transitions by
making links transition when hovered rather than instantly changing color.


\textbf{Responsive Layout}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{form-mobile}

This screenshot shows the same form page depicted above with a narrower
window. The layout has changed to fit better in the mobile-style
aspect ratio.


\section{Contributions}
\textbf{Andrew:}
The starter HTML and CSS, which were from previous assignments (this includes index.html, content.html, location.html, and about.html); the HTML and editorial content of the beverages, more beverages, and blog pages; the animation and transition CSS; a minor CSS bugfix; and this report.

\textbf{Dottie:}
The separate mobile and desktop CSS; the mechanism for switching between mobile and desktop CSS; the dropdown menu in the navigation bar; the entire survey page; the lower-quality images for mobile and the mechanism for using them over the full-sized images; the table CSS; and all other JavaScript.

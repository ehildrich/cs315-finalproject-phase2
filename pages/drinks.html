		<h2>Coffee-Based Beverages</h2>
		<p>Coffee has been prepared and served in various ways
		throughout history. While many enthusiasts see
		the "true" form of coffee as espresso or black brewed coffee,
		there are other drinks made with coffee that have become very
		popular, in no small part because of the rise of Starbucks, a
		fast-cafe chain that focuses heavily on coffee-based beverages.
		<p>
    </section>

    <section>
		<h3>Milk and Espresso</h3>
		<p>Many coffee-based beverages are made using some combination
		of milk and espresso, potentially alongside other ingredients.
		Many of these drinks have their origins in early espresso culture
		in Italy, but as Italians tend to prefer smaller,
		stronger coffees, with a high ratio of espresso to other ingredients,
		many of these early drinks have been
		reinterpreted for American and other audiences, who prefer
		larger beverages that last longer and don't pack too big a punch.
		</p>

		<h4>Macchiato</h4>
		<p>
		The original macchiato has its origins in Italy. At espresso
		cafes, baristas would often mark espresso that included a
		small amount of milk with a dot of foamed milk on the top, making
		the difference between shots with and without milk more obvious.
		This gave the macchiato its name, as "macchiato" means "marked"
		in Italian. Starbucks has reused this name for a very different
		line of drinks, lattes "marked" with drizzles of sauce. The
		amount of milk used in the traditional macchiato varies, but is
		quite small, with recipes often calling for 5-10 mL of milk, and
		25-60 mL of espresso. Overall, this drink aims to stay close to
		plain espresso while taking the edge off with milk.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Cappuccino</h4>
		<p>
		The cappuccino also has roots in Italian espresso culture.
		(In fact, it goes even further back!)
		The traditional story of its origin is that customers at cafes
		would specify how much milk they wanted in their espresso by
		referring to various brown objects encountered in daily life.
		One of these was the <em>capuche</em>, a cowl worn in brown by
		the Capuchin monks (as well as other religious orders, but they
		did not necessarily wear brown <em>capuche</em>). The cappuccino
		centers steamed milk, so now is a good time to explain steamed milk.
		Most espresso machines have a steam wand that can release steam
		from a boiler when a valve is turned. This steam wand can be
		partially submerged in milk at an angle. If done correctly, this
		will both heat the milk and incorporate air into it, giving it
		a silky or foamy texture, depending on the particular technique
		used. The cappuccino is traditionally made with equal parts
		espresso (traditionally 1 shot,
		around 30 mL, but the recipe is often scaled up for a larger
		serving), steamed milk, and milk foam. It is also common to
		use relatively more milk and/or foam to fit the tastes of
		American audiences.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Caffe Latte</h4>
		<p>A caffe latte (literally "coffee milk") is similar to a
		cappuccino, but features less milk foam and much more steamed
		milk. A typical recipe might use a cup of steamed milk and one
		or two shots of espresso for an 8 fl. oz. drink, scaling up
		from there. This drink has become a staple at Starbucks and
		competitor, where it is often heavily sweetened with various
		flavored syrups. A latte made with cocoa as well as coffee
		is called a caffe Mocha, after the city in Yemen that was a
		center of the historical coffee trade.

		<h3>Other Drinks</h3>

		<h4>Caffe Americano</h4>
		<p>The caffe americano has an Italian name, but may not have
		Italian origins. One folk etymology claims that Italians
		diluted espresso to serve American tastes during or after
		the Second World War. A different account claims the term
		arose in Latin America. At any rate,
		an Americano is a drink made with espresso and water that
		aims at a perceived strength similar to brewed coffee. It
		typically uses around a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio of espresso to hot
		water (or cold water and ice for an iced version). If you're
		at a cafe and want a drink that tastes like brewed coffee,
		but don't want
		batch brew that could be several hours old, ordering a caffe
		Americano is a great way to guarantee that your drink will
		be made fresh.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Redeye</h4>
		<p> This drink is also quite simple, consisting of brewed
		coffee "fortified" with espresso.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Iced Coffee</h4>
		<p>Hopefully you can figure this one out. One common trick to
		preserve intensity of flavor despite dilution with ice is to
		brew with a shorter ratio to begin with (more coffee or less
		water), because water is introduced by the ice.
